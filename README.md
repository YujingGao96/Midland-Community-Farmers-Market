## Website Introduction
This website is a student project that is built for Midland Community Farmers Market. All copyrights are reserved for Midland Community Farmers Market.
Website aims for all vendors who would like to sell their items in the market. Website not only displays necessary information for all vendors, but also has the reservation system that allows vendors to pay for the fee online by using PayPal. The reservation system has an integrated MySQL database which stores all vendors information and participated events. The payment information is not stored in the database for security concerns.
